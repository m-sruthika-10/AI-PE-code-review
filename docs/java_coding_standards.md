# Java Coding Standards

Java coding standards are guidelines that help developers write clean,
maintainable, and efficient code. Here are some key aspects of Java coding
standards:

### 1\. Naming Conventions

  * **Classes** : Use CamelCase. E.g., `CustomerOrder`.

  * **Methods** : Use camelCase. E.g., `calculateTotal()`.

  * **Variables** : Use camelCase. E.g., `totalAmount`.

  * **Constants** : Use uppercase letters with underscores. E.g., `MAX_VALUE`.

### 2\. Indentation and Spacing

  * Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).

  * Place opening braces on the same line as the declaration.

  * Use a single space after keywords (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`).

### 3\. Comments

  * Use Javadoc comments for public classes and methods.

  * Use single-line comments (`//`) for brief explanations.

  * Use multi-line comments (`/* ... */`) for longer explanations.

### 4\. Code Structure

  * Keep methods short and focused on a single task.

  * Group related methods together.

  * Use packages to organize classes logically.

### 5\. Exception Handling

  * Use specific exceptions rather than generic ones.

  * Always clean up resources in a `finally` block or use try-with-resources.

### 6\. Use of Access Modifiers

  * Use `private` for class members unless access is needed.

  * Use `protected` and `public` judiciously.

### 7\. Avoid Magic Numbers

  * Use named constants instead of hard-coded values.

### 8\. Use of Annotations

  * Use annotations like `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, and custom annotations appropriately.

### 9\. Consistent Use of Braces

  * Always use braces for `if`, `for`, and `while` statements, even if they contain a single statement.

### 10\. Code Formatting

  * Use a consistent style for line length (typically 80-120 characters).

  * Break long lines for readability.
